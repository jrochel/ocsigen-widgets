  (** Handler associated to a (dyn_upload) [service]. You have to provide
      a function which will take the file name. This handler allows
      you to do some manipulation on the file which will be uploaded.

      You can provide some functions to custom the uploaded file. You
      can set a [timeout], enable the remove of unused file, using
      [remove_on_timeout]. You can also
      provide a function to generate a new filename ([new_filename]).

      You can also give a list of valid extensions. If a file, does not
      have a valid extension, and exception of type [Invalid_extension]
      will be raised.
