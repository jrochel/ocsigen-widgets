(**

   Widget to upload a picture, check it on server side, resize it,
   and possibly ask the user to crop it.

*)
(**

   Call function [make] for each picture uploader you want to create,
   with some parameters like the directory where you want to save the
   pictures.
   This will create a service and the widget to upload in this
   directory using this service.

   Be careful to set the right options in Ocsigen server's configuration file
   to be able to upload files and limit the maximum size of uploaded files.

(** The type of picture uploaders. *)
type t

}}

(** [make ~directory ~name ()] creates a picture uploader in [directory]
    with a service called [name] (choose the name you want, as lon g as two
    uploaders have different names).

    - If optional argument [crop_ratio] is present, the user will be asked
    to crop the picture. [None] means that no ratio will be forced.
    [Some  v] means that the widget will impose width / height = v.
    - Optional aguments [?max_height] and [?max_width] are used
    if you want the picture to be resized (for example to avoid large files).
    Images will never be enlarged.
    If the the image is to be cropped, the resizing will be made after cropping.
    - Argument [?continuation] contains the action to be executed
    after the picture is saved in the destination directory

    be called with the name of the file on server as parameter
    (use this for example to close the popup window).

    - Argument [~url_path] is the URL path of the directory containing
    these pictures on the server.
    - Argument [~text] is the text you want to display before the form.
    - Arguments [~err_log] and [std_log] are the client-side functions to use
    to display (error or information) messages. Example [Eba_msg.log]
    if you are using Eliom base app (as client values if you are using this
    from server side).
