  (** Jcrop gives you crop tools to redefine an <img> tag. You have to pass.
      this image as parameter to apply tools on it.

      There are some parameters to configure the tools. (description come from
      the original website):
      @param on_select Called when selection is completed.
      @param on_change Called when the selection is moving.
      @param on_release Jcrop has a sense of state, whether there is an active selection or not. this is called when the selection is released.
      @param aspect_ratio Aspect ratio of w/h (e.g. 1 for square).
      @param min_size Minimum width/height, use 0 for unbounded dimension.
      @param max_size Maximum width/height, use 0 for unbounded dimension.
      @param set_select Set an initial selection area.
      @param bg_color Set color of background container (default: "black").
      @param bg_opacity Opacity of outer image when cropping (default: 0.6).
