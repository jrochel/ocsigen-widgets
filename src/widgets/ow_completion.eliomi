  (** Provides behaviours of a completion widget.

      The main purpose of this widget is to complete on string value.
      [completion] uses [dropdown] to display matched values. Each item of the
      [dropdown] {b MUST HAVE} an attribute {b data-value}. The value of this
      attribute will be used during comparaison with the input value.

      [refresh limit pattern] must return the list of the different values.
      The [pattern] correspond to the current input value, and [limit] is the
      number of items which will be displayed by the widgets.

      If you don't want to do the comparaison with the value by yourself, you
      can use [auto_match] which will filter the list of elements returned by
      [refresh] function. Element which doesn't match the input value, will be
      ignored and won't be displayed with the [dropdown].

      [accents] indicates if the widget has to take care of accents in the
      {b data-value} attribute and input value.  [sensitive] indicates the case
      has to be insensitive or not.

      If you want to begin the completion from the start of input value, you
      can set [from_start] to [true]. Otherwise, it will try to match the value
      anywhere in the {data-value} string.

      [force_refresh] will automatically force the call to the [refresh]
      function on each actions of the widget. If this option is enabled, the
      rendering could blink.

      [clear_input_on_confirm] will clear the input when method [confirm] is
      called.

      Because [completion] is a [dropdown], and a [dropdown] is composed by
      [traversable] widget, you can navigate through matched values using
      arrow keys. You can also iterate through them using tab key, if the
      option [move_with_tab] is set to [true]

      If [adaptive] is enabled, so the input value will be automatically set
      to the {b data-value} of current active matched element (when navigating
      using arrow keys).

      The function [on_confirm] is called each time the input value is
      confirmed (using [confirm] method or using enter key).

      The widget need an {b input} element as first parameter. The second
      parameter is the container on which the matched values will be
      automatically inserted, it must be a {b ul} element.
