  (** This function adds a custom scrollbar to the element [elt]. There are
      several optionnal callbacks that you can add at construction, but you can
      also add them later.

      @param height Determine the height of the scrollbar. If none, the
      scrollbar will have the size of the element.

      @param scroll Determine the starting position of the dragger.

      @param inertia Scrolling inertia in milliseconds. Really low
      values (<10) are forced to 10, because it breaks the scrollbar when
      under 10. Low values are irrelevant anyway, since the user can't
      even see it. To disable the inertia, put 0.

      @param mouse_wheel_pixels Mouse wheel scrolling amount in pixel. If
      undefined , the value "auto" is used. *)
